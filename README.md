CSS3 Sliding Dropdown
========================

This is a familiar sliding navigation menu. But this one's special: it's both [semantic][sem] and entirely CSS3. Baller.

### Compatibility

This works perfectly in all the good browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera.

IE, on the other hand, falls a bit short. This is because IE still doesn't support CSS3 transitions (come on, Microsoft!). What this means is that the submenu will just 'pop' into existence on IE, instead of sliding.

I hope you like it.
