CSS3 Sliding Dropdown
========================

This is a familiar sliding navigation menu. But this one's special: it's both [semantic][sem] and entirely CSS3. Baller.

### Compatibility

This works perfectly in all the modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and IE10. It also utilizes the [iOS :hover double-click feature][click].

IE9 and previously, on the other hand, don't support transitions. What this means is that the submenu will just 'pop' into existence instead of sliding.

Anyway, I hope you like it.
