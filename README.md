CSS3 Sliding Dropdown
========================

### Under Construction

This is a typical sliding menu. But it's a special sliding menu: it's [semantic][sem] and made only with CSS3.

### Compatibility

This is 100% compatible with Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox.

This will function on IE6+, but it won't display as nicely in IE as in those other browsers. This is because IE still doesn't support CSS3 transitions (come on, Microsoft!). Anyway, the submenu will just 'pop' into existence on IE, instead of sliding.

I hope you like it!
